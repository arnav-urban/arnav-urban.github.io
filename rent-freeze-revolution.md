# Rent Freeze Revolution  
### Could Delhi Take a Page from Zohran Mamdani’s Playbook?

## Overview

A one-bedroom apartment in Delhi now costs more than what a student or a working-class family earns in a month. Between 2021 and 2024, rents in the city rose by nearly 70 percent — not gradually, not quietly, but fast enough to push entire populations to the edge.

This essay places Delhi’s rental crisis alongside Zohran Mamdani’s New York mayoral campaign, which reframed housing not as a market commodity but as public infrastructure. It asks why Indian cities continue to treat rent inflation as inevitable, even as existing laws remain selectively enforced and political imagination stays constrained.

By reading Delhi’s housing crisis through rent control laws, market behaviour, and political mobilisation, the piece argues that rising rents are not a natural outcome of scarcity. They are produced — and therefore can be regulated.

## Why This Matters

Delhi’s rental crisis is often framed as a planning or supply problem. But this framing avoids the real question: why is housing still treated as a market good when markets have clearly failed migrants, students, and workers?

Rent freezes and public housing are dismissed as unrealistic, even as the state repeatedly demonstrates its capacity to act decisively — usually through demolitions and evictions. This piece argues that the failure is not technical. It is political. What is missing is not policy capacity, but the willingness to imagine housing outside profit.
