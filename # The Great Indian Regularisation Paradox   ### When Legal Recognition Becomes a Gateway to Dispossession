## Overview

In Delhi’s unauthorised colonies, regularisation is often framed as a moment of arrival — a promise of legality, dignity, and security for residents who have lived for decades on the margins of formal planning. Provisional certificates are distributed, photographs are taken, and the language of rights enters everyday conversations.

Yet this moment of recognition carries a quieter consequence. Once land enters official records, it also enters the market. Property values rise sharply, speculative interest intensifies, and informal community arrangements are exposed to financial pressures they were never designed to withstand.

This essay examines how regularisation, far from being a simple welfare intervention, often becomes a mechanism through which informality is folded into urban land markets. Drawing on Delhi’s unauthorised colonies and the idea of accumulation by dispossession, it argues that legal recognition can paradoxically produce new forms of vulnerability, displacement, and spatial injustice.


## Why This Matters

Regularisation is rarely just about legality. It reshapes land values, political incentives, and everyday survival strategies. For planners and policymakers, the challenge is not whether to recognise informal settlements, but how recognition is structured, sequenced, and governed.

Without safeguards, regularisation risks turning residents into speculative assets — formally recognised, yet materially displaced. The paradox lies here: dignity is promised through law, but eroded through the market.
